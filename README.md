# ORFfinder
ORFfinder is a simple Python-based tool that uses a Trie data structure to efficiently find and extract Open Reading Frames (ORFs) from a genome sequence. The genome consists of characters A, B, C, and D. The tool allows users to search for substrings (ORFs) that start with a specific prefix and end with a specific suffix.
